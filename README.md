### Initializing the Repo

* Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/rock-band-3-deluxe/releases)** of this repo and **download `init_repo.py`**.
  * Make a new **empty** folder, **put `init_repo.py` in the folder, and run it**.
      * This will pull the repo for you and install all required dependencies. **This will take some time.**
      * You may have to run the script multiple times on Windows.

### ***The folder should look something like this once it's done:***
